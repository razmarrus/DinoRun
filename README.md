# Basic info

Project has been inspired by [article](https://medium.com/acing-ai/how-i-build-an-ai-to-play-dino-run-e37f37bdf153) about using reinforcement learning the Dino Run game.
Originally, author use Selenium as an intarlayer between in-game data and neural network, but it only works for java-script realization. 
This one works for [python pygame realization](https://code-projects.org/dino-game-in-python-with-source-code/) with several modifications.
## How to launch

- Pygame libriary must be installed to run game itself
- Keras and OpenCV must be installed to run neural network
- unzip buffer.rar file in root of the project 
- unzip D.rar file in DinoRun/Dino_runGame/objects/
